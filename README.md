# ðŸŽ† Diwali Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project dives deep into analyzing Diwali sales data to uncover valuable insights into consumer behavior during the festive season. Using Python, I meticulously cleaned the dataset, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identified key trends that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Insights
- **Target Audience:** The analysis revealed that married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, particularly those working in IT, healthcare, and aviation sectors, are more likely to purchase products during Diwali.
- **Popular Categories:** Food, clothing, and electronics emerged as the most popular categories among these consumers, offering significant opportunities for targeted promotions and inventory planning.

## Process & Tools
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured the data was accurate and ready for analysis by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a thorough EDA to identify patterns and trends using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Visualizations:** Created compelling visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
